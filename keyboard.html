        <p>I copied this piano keyboard in Javascript based on the <a
                href="https://www-freecodecamp-org.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-piano-keyboard/amp/#step1">dynamically
                generated synthetic keyboard</a> made by Keith William Horwood. Joe Liang extended the number of keys
            available to 4 octaves, set new key bindings, applied some stylistic changes, and posted this to www-freecodecamp-org. To keep things simple, he
            removed the option of switching to different instrument sounds and just kept piano.  There was also no CSS file, as Joe had it as a script in the HTML file.  I added one and plan on getting the other instrument functionality back at some point.</p>

        <p>What makes this keyboard interesting is the fact that Javascript dynamically generates the appropriate sound
            when the user presses a key and the code does not load any external audio files.</p>
